Hi! My name is Neil but I like to be called Nvn
I'm currently learning web development and data science, between others learning paths that I'm following related to idioms, music and calisthenics.

I'm interested in whole science spectrum, looking for tools to spread digital world onto every person's life in order to impact people and their respectives self-development
I strongly believe in education as the master key for all grow,for individual, collective and social spheres.

You can contact me here and message me if you want to work on a project together.
